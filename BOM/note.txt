1. we can use resize and scroll event listener in window and element both

2.screenLeft == screenX, screenTop == screenY ,but screenX and screenY uses is better practice

3.pageXOffset == scrollX , pageYOffset == scrollY,but scrollX and scrollY uses is better practice

4.scrollBy and scrollTo can use also in DOM property for elements
